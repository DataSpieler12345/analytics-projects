ðŸš€ Welcome to my custom Power BI visuals project!
In this project, we explore how to enhance traditional Power BI dashboards by integrating HTML and CSS to create interactive, animated, and visually appealing custom views. From animated KPIs to dynamic progress bars and ticker effects, we push the limits of Power BI visuals using native DAX measures and HTML rendering. These techniques allow for a richer user experience while still being fully responsive to filters and slicers.

## Technologies Used
