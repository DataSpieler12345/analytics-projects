promt10: Can you write an html script for a KPI card in which the KPI number loads like a ticker as that at the airport in which the tickers of three digits rotate to form the final number?


promnt11: Create a DAX measure for this html code so I can use it in Power BI. Enclose this html code in a DAX measure.

prompt12: Make the following adjustments:
          Make the background transparent.
	  Make the font style Arial
	  Make the fon color white
          Remove any frames or borders around the numbers


promt13:The numbers are not loading. They are zero constantly.
	The total time span should be 0.7 seconds to complete the visual. Place the number in the middle and not left aligned. Make the fon Arial regular.

promt14: The numbers are zero constantly. Can you modify the DAX and gie me the update one?

prompt15:Can you modify the DAX so that it takes the three-digit value from a Power Bi Measure calle "KPI_(Top Speed)"?

prompt16: Make the bar slimmer, around 30% of the current thickness.
	  Include animation of around 0.7 seconds, where the bar goes from the start to the final value.

promt17: Create the animation in the rating, where it behaves as a ticker, whereas the maximum value of /10 should remain without animation. 
	 The bar animation should start after the ticker animation is finished.

prompt18: Create a DAX expression for this html, where the rating should be based on Measure: "Rating | Average".
	  Also make sure that the visual refreshes when the filter or slicer is selected and the value of the Measure changes.

prompt19: But the animation of the bar chart should be there. Hence, when the filter is selected, the animation starts from zero to the final value.
